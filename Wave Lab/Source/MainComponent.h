  /// Constructor. Your method should take the following actions:
  /// * Add and make visible all subcomponents.
  /// * Add the main component as a listener to all the buttons and sliders.
  /// * The ComboBox (menu) should display "Waveforms" if nothing is selected in the menu.
  /// * The menu has 5 sections, use ComboBox::addItemList() to add each section.
  ///   After each section add a separator item (See ComboBox::addSeparator())
  /// - The first section contains the strings "White", "Brown", "Dust" and starts
  /// with the id WhiteNoise.
  /// - The second section contains just the string "Sine" with the id SineWave.
  /// - The third section contains "LF Impulse", "LF Square", "LF Saw", "LF Triangle" and
  /// its ids start with LF_ImpulseWave.
  /// - The fourth section contains "BL Impulse", "BL Square", "BL Saw", "BL Triangle"
  /// and starts with BL_ImpulseWave.
  /// - The fifth section contains "WT Sine", "WT Impulse", "WT Square", "WT Saw", "WT Triangle"
  ///  and starts with WT_SineWave.
  /// *  Add the level slider to MainComponent with proper text box style
  /// and range (0.0-1.0).
  /// * Both slider textboxes should be initilized to Slider::TextBoxLeft with a width of
  /// 90 and height of 22. The level slider should have a range of 0 to 1.
  /// * The frequecy slider should range from 0.0, 5000.0 and should be initially disabled
  /// (It will enabled whenever the menu selection has a frequency.) Set its "mid point
  /// skew factor" to 500 (See: Slider::setSkewFactorFromMidPoint()),
  /// * The play button should initially be disabled and draw the button in its initial Play mode.
  /// * Set the label justification of the cpu label and display to Justification::centredRight.
  /// * Finally, add our audioSourcePlayer to the audio device manager for audio
  ///   streaming.  Since our component inherits from AudioSource, it will become the audio
  ///   source for the player to stream when we call audioSourcePlayer.setSource(this);
